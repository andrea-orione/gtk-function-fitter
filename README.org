# gtk-function-fitter
* What is this
This is a simple program that i made to quickly analyze data when I'm in lab and I don't have time to code the specific analysis for the single experiment.
Since I'm not a software developer it may crash or have some bugs that I did not test, so be aware of this when you use it.
However I hope it is useful and it's not a pain to use it

* Requirements
To run this program it is required to have installed:
 - The ROOT framework from Cern
 - Gtk (it has been written for version 3, not sure it works with other versions)
